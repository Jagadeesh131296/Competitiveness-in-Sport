The level of competition between competing teams defines a sporting event. A sport
competition is an activity in which multiple teams compete against one another with the
goal of winning the game. Competitiveness amongst the sports leagues are the situations
or activities in which the teams compete with each other in the league. This research
examines the competitiveness of professional cricket leagues around the world using a
variety of metrics based on data from T20 (twenty-two) cricket games. The research also
uses the clustering techniques to analyse the performance of the players with respect to
their auction price in Indian Premier League. This study can be useful for the growth of
a sports-related business as well as for the improvement of player’s skill sets by assessing
their weak points using data analysis. The statistical analyses are carried out to find the
most competitive league among the leagues and the clustering techniques are utilized in
building the models for the player’s performance analysis. Indian Premier League (IPL),
Big Bash League (BBL), Caribbean Premier League (CPL) and T20 Blast of England
are analysed in the study. K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN
clustering techniques are used in this research to cluster players in groups with similar
performances in the Indian Premier League (IPL) by finding patterns in the data and
groups players logically based on the patterns. The T20 Blast of England is found out to
be the most competitive league using the competitive analysis measure.
